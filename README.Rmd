The goal of package sirstochastic is to run simulations of single and multiple iterations of the SIR stochastic model, compartmental and individual.

## Installation

You can install the released version of sirstochastic from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sirstochastic")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("reside-ic/sirstochastic")
```
## COMPARTMENTAL
## Equations

The equations defining the model are:

* dS/dt = - beta * S * I / N
* dI/dt = beta * S * I / N - sigma * I
* dR/dt = sigma * I


and these are converted to the discrete stochastic model by imagining that in a small period of time `dt` the chance of an event happening follows a Bernoulli trial. In a discrete time step of size `dt` we model the number of infections (i.e., the number of individuals who move from `S` to `I`) as a binomial draw with `n = S` and `p = beta * I / N * dt`) and the number of recoveries (movements from `I` to `R`) as a binomial draw with `n = I` and `p = sigma * dt`. Note, N = S + I + R.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. The model is run once for 10,000 iterations with a time step of 0.01.

```{r 1run10000points, echo=FALSE}
options(warn = - 1) 
pars <- sirstochastic::get_parameters()
end_time <- 100

df <- sirstochastic::compartmental_sirmodel(end_time, pars)
sirstochastic:::displaythemodel(df)

```

This time the model is run a 100 times for 10,000 iterations with a time step of 0.01 using the same code.

```{r 100runs10000points, echo=FALSE}
options(warn = - 1) 
pars <- sirstochastic::get_parameters()
end_time <- 100

df <- lapply(seq_len(100), function(simulation) sirstochastic::compartmental_sirmodel(end_time, pars))

sirstochastic:::displaythemodel(df) 

```

## INDIVIDUAL

## SIR individul model with same probabilities as compartmental

```{r 1run10000pointsindividual, echo=FALSE}
library('remotes')
install_github('mrc-ide/individual')
library(individual)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

options(warn = - 1) 
pars <- sirstochastic::get_parameters()

population <- pars$N
NI <- pars$I0
NR <- 2
pops <- population - NI - NR
timestep <- pars$num/pars$dt

S <- State$new('S', pops)
I <- State$new('I', NI)
R <- State$new('R', NR)

human <- Individual$new('human', list(S, I, R))

processes <- list(
  sirstochastic::individual_S_to_I(S, I, human, pars),
  sirstochastic::individual_I_to_R(I, R, human, pars),
  sirstochastic::individual_R_to_S(S, R, human, pars),
  sirstochastic::render_state_sizes(S, I, R, human)
)

output <- simulate(human, processes, timestep)

df <-   data.frame(S = output$susceptable_counts, I = output$infected_counts, R = output$recovered_counts, time = output$time, type = "Individual",  legend = "Individual", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

sirstochastic:::displaythemodel(df)

```
